# RateMySite

### What is it
This is a website which allows people to post their personal websites and get comments and feedback on them. It also acts as a collection of these sites to be viewed for inspiration.

### How is it
The frontend is made with ReactJS. This repository contains two backends. One made with NodeJs/Express which can be run locally and I used for testing. The other is for serverless deployment with AWS Lambda, API gateway, and RDS. This is how the website is currently deployed.

### Where is it
This website is currently available at [ratemysite.xyz](https://ratemysite.xyz).
